# SenCar 5 Documentation
Hi. This is the place where I write how the fuck everything inside of SenCar 5 works, both for you reading this, and me in the future. This includes my thought process on almost everything, code examples, and why things are what they are. Well. Good luck. Yes, I'm pretty sure this is one of the only micros in the game to require documentation. Fuck me.

## How does SenCar 5 work?
In short, SenCar 5 works just like every other microcontroller in Stormworks: logic. The numbers feed into the ever-growing microcontroller (mc), and feed into the LUA blocks (or somewhere else), and then runs through the code seen in this repository.
