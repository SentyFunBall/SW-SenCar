# SW-SenCar-5
[Developer Documentation](docs/docs.md)

SenCar 5 is the greatest new evolution of the SenTOS Car OS line of operating systems. SenTOS Car was built for the original 2nd gen Echolodia (Echolodia 2021), and has been continually evolving ever since. However, the looks of the operating system has stayed mostly the same, with no major overhaul in the last 2 years. This is where it changes.
SenTOS Car 4 was our largest update to date, adding tons of quality of life features that let us focus on UI overhauls. Now called SenCar, This latest evolution changes everything you were used too. Not sorry.
